# Good Vs Evil
## The exercise involves calculating the outcome of a battle between the forces of good and evil in Middle Earth. Each race on both sides has a specific "worth" or strength value
### Good Side Races and Their Worth:
```
Hobbits: 1
Men: 2
Elves: 3
Dwarves: 3
Eagles: 4
Wizards: 10
```

### Evil Side Races and Their Worth:

```
Orcs: 1
Men: 2
Wargs: 2
Goblins: 2
Uruk Hai: 3
Trolls: 5
Wizards: 10
```

Based on this CodeWars exercise I wrote a quick program that would calculate the worths and return certain strings.
Return 
``` "Battle Result: Good triumphs over Evil" ``` 
if good wins, 
```"Battle Result: Evil eradicates all trace of Good"```
if evil wins, or 
```"Battle Result: No victor on this battle field"```
if it ends in a tie.
